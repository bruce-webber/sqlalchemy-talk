# Introduction to SQLAlchemy

The slides and code were created for an Introduction to SQLAlchemy class held
at i3Detroit (https://www.i3detroit.org/).

See the docs folder for a the presentation in ODP format, a spreadsheet with
the sample data, and a PDF showing the database schema.

There are three code examples:

## SQLite

This is SQL code to be executed at the SQLite command prompt.

## Python SQLite3

This demonstrates the use of Python's sqlite3 package. The SQL is still low
level.

## SQLAlchemy

The same database is modeled and accessed using SQLAlchemy.
